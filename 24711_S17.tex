\subsection{Zeno's Paradox of the Arrow}

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em 
    \item  An object is at rest during an interval iff it occupies only a
        single position during that interval (not during a moment of time).
        It's stationary during an instant only if the instant is contained in
        an interval during which it's at rest. 
    \item Ancient Greeks could only answer the question qualitatively because
        they couldn't measure time (although they could measure distances). Use
        a compass to make circles and form multiples of a unit length on a
        line.
    \item Can use a straight edge and compass to get an estimate of length to
        any precision up to a rational number, but no further.
    \item Aristotelian physics gives no good way of measuring a length of time.
        Earth, air, wind, fire all have natural motion (up, down), but because
        of acceleration you can't figure out good lengths of time - you need
        something that moves at a uniform speed. The natural motion of things
        in the heavens is circular, so you can use star movement to measure
        lengths of time (not as simple as one would think because Aristotle's
        system was geo-centric where the planets orbited in a circle about the
        earth).
    \item
        Need to be able to measure time and distance in order to measure speed
        and so to get close to a solution for the core question of what it
        means to be stationary.
    \item
        Galileo look at pendulum movement - he saw a smooth continuous movement
        that happens at intervals (PE being converted into KE). The
        Aristotelian saw chaotic movement in the pendulum (you are displacing
        the bob and it's swinging is it trying to go downward but being
        contained by the string). Aristotle didn't have the principle of
        balancing of forces on the bob. Aristotle's answer to the question of
        why the bob doesn't stop is that there is some nonsense with a vacuum
        of air being generated behind the bob and pushing it forward. We can
        measure time by dividing the length of the pendulum rod and noting the
        period is inversely related to the square of the length of the rod.
    \item
        Speed during an interval is the quotient of change of distance over
        change and time. Zeno gave us the idea of 0 speed over an interval, now
        we have a quantitative idea of non-zero speed during an interval. But
        we still have to account for the idea that the ball is at rest only at
        its apogee but at no other point in its path.
    \item 
        We can solve the ball problem by solving $x'(t) = 0$, where $x'$ is the
        limit of the difference quotient of $(x(t + h) - x(t))/h$. Aristotle
        thought that bodies were the only things that were real and that bodies
        aren't made up of points or surfaces. So we can't just think of the
        ball but also need to consider the position in spacetime of the ball -
        we need to think of the trajectory (potential positions occupied by the
        ball) as existent, even when the ball isn't there. But Aristotle argued
        that a line isn't made up of points so this doesn't play out well under
        Aristotelian physics - i.e. we can talk about velocities but not of
        instantaneous velocities.
    \item 
        Why does Aristotle preclude the solution of taking the derivative? Do
        we not just take the limit over smaller and smaller intervals about the
        instant? The Aristotelian post-Newton understood the limit as the
        continual dividing of the line into smaller pieces.
    \item
        Things change when we switch to dynamics - throw a ball up at some
        initial speed and the downward force of gravity will decelerate the
        ball until it reaches 0. But since acceleration is $dv/dt$ there's no
        good way to define instantaneous acceleration out of velocity, which is
        also a function.
    \item
        You know there are times when the ball is going up and times when the
        ball is going down. We want to say there is a time when the ball
        reaches its highest point when its velocity was 0, how do we know there
        was such a time? We could solve this with the IVT but we want to do
        this constructively by constructing the cut between positive velocities
        and negative velocities. Can we get the LUB principle from numbers just
        from the movement of the ball? If the LUB principle didn't hold for the
        numbers then there would points in the ball's flight where it didn't
        have any associated number for its height.
    \item 
        Most of what we can use real numbers for (measurements of things) we
        can get away with just rational numbers. Dedekind had originally the
        bad idea that we could get away with just rational numbers, but that
        was thrown out with $\sqrt{2}$ and the Ancients. Also need cube roots
        to deal with the roots of cubic polynomials. So the real numbers fall
        out of solving polynomials with rational coefficients - but this
        doesn't solve the ball problem because you have no reason to believe
        that the place where the ball is stationary is the root of an equation.
    \item 
        The Ancients don't allow for the idea that there is a point on a line
        that is defined by the all the points to the right of it or to the left
        of it. For the ball, there needs to be a top point to define the switch
        of signs.
    \item
        Is it true that there is a supremum of all the points achieved by the
        ball? Is the ball at rest at this point? What if the ball only achieves
        heights of rational numbers (so it skips between points) or if the ball
        has a hole at the maximum of its height curve?
    \item
        From Mathematica, you have a tire on a hubcap that each go through the
        same number of rotations - how does the hubcap not move much less
        distance than the tire? Galileo: the tire is just a polygon, the hubcap
        goes through places where there is no corner of the polygon
        instantaneously which is just a wacky idea.
    \item 
        Conclusion: you can't explain what is going on if you just think in
        terms of bodies and don't think about space and lines as being made up
        of points.
    \item
        An alternative view says that only bodies are real, and the bodies can
        be in different places but the places aren't real, just the bodies are
        (and the distance relations they have with each other). Kant disputed
        this view - if God made a single marble hand before anything else, then
        He could've made either a right hand or a left hand (it has to be one
        or the other), but if all we have is bodies with spatial relations then
        there is nothing different between a right hand and a left hand; but
        there is a difference between right hand and left hhand so there has to
        be something to account for the difference - you need position.

\subsection{Dedekind's Construction of $\mathbb{R}$}

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em 
    \item  
        Jill starts at the bottom of a hill when Jack starts and the top and
        the reach the top/bottom at the same time. Is there a point where they
        are at the same elevation? Yes - take the set of all times when the
        difference in height was positive and then take the least upper bound.
        Most people say that it comes from their motion being continuous.
    \item
        Really early on people learned how to use numbers to measure things -
        at least from having to re-establish property lines after the flooding
        of the Nile. This entailed measurement by yardstick which always yield
        results in fractional form. But can we get these same numerical
        properties without actually deferring to the use of numbers? 
    \item
        The rationals as fractions seem very well understood - the gaps between
        them were less well understood. We know that all the rationals along
        the path will be reached by the ball - how can we justify whether there
        are non-rational points that are hit by the ball.
    \item
        Pythagoreans found that simple ratios of where you put your finger on
        the lyre string correspond to harmonic sounds, but then one of them
        discovered that there are length sthat aren't rationals. He
        didn't find it out by measurement but rather by reductio ad absurdum -
        finding the length of the diagonal of the square with side length 1. He
        showed that it can't be rational (and was thrown overboard for his
        discovery). So you have to have square roots if you want to do geometry
        like the Greeks (because of conic sections).
    \item
        There's a problem which is for any square find another square that has
        twice the area - it was known by Plato and was in the Meno - solve it
        by taking the diagonal of the first as the side length of the second.
        Can you do this with a cube? You can't do this with a compass and
        straight edge. The medeival Arabics pushed forward by going passed
        compass/straightedge and finding teh roots of a cubic equation without
        requiring that the length we're talking about can be one you can
        actually create with a compass and straightedge. That produced a whole
        new family of lengths never talked about by the Greeks. It was widely
        believed that you could create new numbers by constructing equations
        with irrational roots with only rational coefficients. For example $x^3
        = 2$ you would introduce $\sqrt[3]{2}$. It was widely thought that all
        the real numbers were got by solving such equations, but for example
        $\pi$ isn't.
    \item
        Cantor showed that there are many more real numbers that aren't
        solutions to equations than ones there are. The question at the end of
        the 19th century was how to get a picture of what the real line was
        like - how to fill in all the holes. Dedekind's answer was to introduce
        the cuts. To fill in all the gaps, we need a cut everywhere. He gave a
        criteria for what it would mean for $\mathbb{R}$ to be complete, and
        second to show that there really was such a thing as that complete
        system of real numbers. The algebraic properties of the real numbers
        are relatively easy to satisfy, and you need added properties in order
        to fill in all the gaps. The principle Dedekind proposed was the
        least-upper bound principle. He also wanted to convince people that
        this was final - that you couldn't go any further.
    \item
        Dedekind started by seeing if a geometric approach would suffice - he
        thought this was obvious - why? You also need a lot of (controversial)
        set theory to get Dedekind cuts, but the Dedekind cuts do reduce the
        reals to the rationals to the integers. Around this time, everyone
        considered the laws of geometry to be synthetic a priori (Kant), where
        we could only make sense of our sensory experience if we organized them
        into three-dimensional space. It seems dubious that the way we organize
        space should be the foundation of analysis because we have tons of
        applications of the real numbers that have nothing to do with space.
        Also, there's non-Euclidean geometry.
    \item
        Dedekind started by enumerating the rules needed for $\mathbb{R}$:
        field axioms, ordering, etc. But that doesn't distinguish from the
        rationals. You need something more: the completeness principle (LUB).
        Dedekind gives some axioms that the thought could answer the question
        of what the real numbers are, or at least he says the real numbers
        satisfy those structural features. Why is identifying the structural
        features enough to say that you've identified the real numbers? There
        are going to be lots of other algebraic systems that satisfy those
        axioms. You have to also give the intended model for those axioms. The
        physical line satisfies those axioms, but we have no reason to believe
        that any particular one is not the real number system. Also any
        complete model of those axioms is going to be isomorphic to any other.
        Why is giving the structure not enough?
    \item
        At the same time, Frege was investigating the foundations of
        arithmetic. He thought that the only principle he needed was Hume's
        Principle (two collections have the same elements iff there's a
        one-to-one correspondence between the elements). He showed you could
        get PA axioms from Hume's Principle, but he still asked: how do I know
        whether Julius Ceasar is a number? We expect a numeral to pick out a
        definite thing, but we can never do this with only axioms. Dedekind
        introduced the idea that the numerals don't have to stand for definite
        objects - that mathematics is rather about identifying structural
        properties, and that identifying the structure is all you can and need
        to do. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Wednesday, February 22, 2017}

\subsection{Dedekind's Construction of $\mathbb{R}$}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Dedekind asked: what further properties than the normal ordering and
        field properties are necessary to specify the real numbers?
        Completeness. His proposal is to create cuts of the rationals into two
        non-empty classes so that everything in the lower portion is less than
        everything in the upper portion. Completeness means that anytime you
        have such a cut there is a real number defining it. This principle
        amounts to the least-upper bound principle. He showed that this
        condition characterizes the real number system (up to isomorphism).
        Historically, people had made systems that purported to be the real
        numbers but it turned out that they left some numbers out. But Dedekind
        showed that you can't add anything to his system and get anything
        that's properly larger. 
    \item
        The isomorphism theorem says that if you have any two models of his
        axioms $a$ and $b$, you first define the positive integers of $a$ to be
        those that contain $0 \in a$ and are closed under succession (and
        define the positive integers of $b$ the same way), and then define a
        map between the two sets of natural numbers. This map is injective - if
        it weren't, then the set of integers that had mappings would have a LUB
        $b'$, and somewhere between $b'$ and $b' - 1$ you would have an integer
        that gets mapped. This lets you map the rationals of $a$ to the
        rationals of $b$, and so then we get an isomorphism of Dedekind cuts
        and so of the real numbers in $a$ and $b$. 
    \item
        So we've completely characterized the structure we're looking for - how
        do we know that there is something that exhibits that structure?
        Dedekind's response is to define the set of all cuts to be the real
        numbers and then show that this structure satisfies the axioms. So he
        takes the construction to be a sufficient answer to the question of
        what the real numbers are. But it feels like he's just given us
        something that is isomorphic to the real numbers. 
    \item
        Frege equivalently gives structural axioms for the natural numbers, but
        wasn't satisfied because he couldn't answer the question of whether
        Julius Caesar was a natural number. Hume's Principle is a structural
        property that only characterizes the natural numbers up to isomorphism.
    \item
        All we need to construct the natural numbers is an infinite set from
        which we can generate a simply infinite set, but that's non-trivial
        because, starting from Zeno's Paradox, there is a long line of people
        saying that we can't have an infinite set, just a potentially infinite
        set. They say that all we can do is give methods for taking a finite
        sequence and extending it, but the idea that we can treat an infinite
        set as a whole was long treated as contradictory. Dedekind thinks he
        can build an infinite set by taking the totality of objects of his
        thought and take a member of that totality S and form the thought "S is
        an object of one's thought", and then recursively do that. That's a
        one-to-one function from the objects of one's thought to the objects of
        one's though, but it isn't onto because one's ego isn't of the form "X
        is the object of my thought". This skirts the question of potentially
        vs. actually infinite because the totality of objects of thought is
        something given to you, not something constructed.
    \item 
        He says that the natural numbers are a "free created of the human mind"
        which he clarifies as being because they are a result of the process of
        abstraction specified above. This isn't completely new - Cantor does
        something similar when he wants to go beyond the natural numbers into
        the transfinite by looking at the different ways of ordering the
        collection and then defining an order isomorphism and then defining the
        order types as got from the orderings by the process of abstraction.
        You regard two orderings the same if their orderings are isomorphic
        (there's a bijection from one to the other that preserves the order).
        Or you can go even more abstract and say that two totalities are the
        same if there is a bijection between them, irrespective of ordering.
        That gives you the cardinal numbers. Aristotle also gets the objects of
        geometry similarly - he thought of them as ordinary solid bodies but we
        abstract away all the non-geometrical properties. Both Cantor and
        Dedekind were dipping into that tradition.
    \item
        In retrospect, it seems like this is a big transition from thinking of
        mathematical terms like "natural/real/complex number" as denoting
        definite things (not things known from sense-experience, but still
        definite entities) to thinking about them as if we can talk about them
        as definite things once we've characterized them up to isomorphism.
        Modern mathematicians are pretty much invariably subscribers to the
        latter view - you talk about mathematical objects, but mathematical
        objects are what they are because of their properties and properties
        only characterize up to isomorphism. There was a change in the way
        mathematicians talked about mathematical objects that philosophy was
        really slow to notice.
    \item
        Cantor also had a way of creating the real numbers out of the
        rationals. Cantor himself was interested in Fourier Series and when
        they converge, for him the idea that the real numbers were complete was
        cashed out by the idea that series converge whenever it's possible for
        them to converge. For any convergent sequence, we have $\forall k,
        \exists N$ such that $n > N \Rightarrow |a_n - a_N| < \frac{1}{k}$
        (Cauchy sequence). So one criterion for the completeness of the real
        numbers other than the LUB principle is the Cauchy criterion implies
        convergence for any sequence. You can derive one criterion from the
        other. Cantor then defined the equivalence relation between $\{x_n\}$
        and $\{y_n\}$ as for any $k$ there is a sequence term such that $y_n$
        and $x_n$ are arbitrarily close passed the sequence term. You can show
        that Dedekind's and Cantor's principles yield isomorphic copies of the
        real numbers. But the question never arose as to which of these is the
        genuine construction of the real numbers. It didn't occur to them to
        ask: what's a real number - a Dedekind cut or an equivalence class of
        Cauchy sequences?
    \item
        Hilbert's axiomitization of geometry: he gave the set of axioms and
        wasn't initially concerned with the question of whether the system was
        complete. We know we get a model of the geometry axioms if you take a
        point to be an ordered triple of real numbers (identify a point with
        its coordinate in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which doesn't have anything to do
        with space and yet is still a perfectly good model). You also get a
        perfectly good model if you identify a point with an ordered triple of
        algebraic numbers - so the geometric axioms do not require
        completeness. Later on, Hilbert started to worry about completeness and
        so he added an axiom in the 9th edition so that the new axiom system is
        complete. One of the axioms of the original system was the Archimedean
        axiom: you can construct a line segment out of a sub-segment so that
        there is some multiple of the sub-segment that will surpass the end of
        the larger segment. Traditionally, geometric axioms were supposed to
        represent three-dimensional space, but Hilbert rather didn't deny that
        the axioms describe physical space but didn't assume that they were
        about physical space. He said the axioms were about systems that
        satisfy those axioms, and nothing more - there's nothing more to being
        an intended model for the geometric axioms. This is similar to group
        theory - there's no intended model for group theory other than a system
        that satisfies those axioms. This is a real departure from the idea
        that mathematics has a definite subject matter.
    \item
        You can have a name without a referent - for example, "Cerberus" or
        other names that occur within myths. You don't have that with names
        like "Cherry" - there's a definite referent to the name "Cherry". But
        we have these numerals in mathematics (e.g. $\sqrt{2}$) that don't have
        a uniquely determined thing that they refer to. The issue with idea of
        identifying the square root of 2 with the set of all things that when
        squared is 2 is problematic because you can't square a set. And you
        can't identify it with any one object whose square is two for similar
        reasons. There's a worry that Dedekind gave us a construction of what
        he called the real numbers and long before him the Egyptians were using
        numerals that purported to be real numbers, so did the Ancient
        Egyptians refer to a Dedekind cut when they wrote down one such
        numeral? Or, possibly, could the real number signs not refer to
        entities but instead to some action, like the act of taking the
        successor with the natural numbers? Well, the numerals do correspond in
        an objective way similarly to how people's names objectively refer to
        people. If it were purely made up, then there wouldn't be a "correct"
        answer for question with real-numbered answers.
    \item
        Dedekind described what he was doing as the reduction of analysis to
        arithmetic, which was understood to have secure foundations. But
        analysis has less secure foundations because people didn't have a clear
        understanding of continuity and limits and what was required for a
        sequence to converge - there was just a general lack of clarity. It's
        more accurate to say that he reduced analysis to set theory or set
        theory plus arithmetic because what he needs to form the cuts is a lot
        of set theory. Looking back, it seems that he really did do something
        important for our understanding of the foundations of analysis, but it
        was not reducing analysis to arithmetic but rather constructing
        analysis within this theory of sets. Next time let's look at the
        axiomatic theory of sets and consider Dedekind's construction as a
        construction of the real numbers within set theory.
